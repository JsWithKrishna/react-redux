# What is Redux?

- Redux is a state management library for React applications, used to manage and synchronize the application state across components efficiently.

# What need of Redux?

- Redux is needed in React to handle complex state management and to facilitate predictable, centralized, and scalable data flow within the application.

# it is compulsary ?

- Redux is not compulsory in React, but it can be beneficial for managing complex state and data flow in large applications.

# what do ?

- Redux helps manage the state of a React application by providing a centralized store and predictable state changes through reducers.

# How to impliment ?

- Install Redux: Use npm or yarn to install the redux package.

- Create a Store: Set up the Redux store, which holds the application state.

- Define Reducers: Write reducers to specify how the state should change based on actions.

- Create Actions: Declare action types and action creators to trigger state changes.

- Connect Redux to React: Use the react-redux library to connect the store to your React components.

- Access State and Dispatch Actions: Access the state and dispatch actions in your components.

# Redux Features
* State is Immutable (only read direct not update)
* Predictable State Changes (by reducer)
* Middleware Support 

# Redux Disadvantage

* Boilerplate Code
* Complexity for Simple Applications
* Asynchronous Actions (by thungs and saga)


# Alternate of Redux?

- React Context API
